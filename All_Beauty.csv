2.0,false,"06 20 2017","Louis Shkane","This thing is a piece of junk.  The rubber bottom while it helps to keep the unit from sliding around has the added caveat of remaining wet for a long period of time after a shave.  How do you dry it?  I don't know.  Perhaps by turning it on its side until it air dries.  In  the meantime what then to do with one's razor and more importantly one's shaving brush which must be stored with the bristles facing downward so the knot does not get ruined from getting soaked?  Also", this unit is rather tall so it will not easily fit into a cabinet recess or on a cabinet shelf.  I guess the unit is okay as long as you can leave it out but I would still recommend placing it on  a dry paper towel after shaving to prevent mildew from forming and worse

4.0,true,"07 7 2017","Don Powers","Really like this stand.  My only criticism and reason I give it 4 stars","is that in spite of all the reviews that said Harry's razors would fit it is only a half truth.  The razor dose indeed \"fit\" but the fit is tight and only at one narrow spot well below the blade.  Further when I take the razor off the stand I must hold the stand with one hand and pull the razor out with the other.  My Tweezerman brush fits wonderfully and truthfully the tight razor fit is a minor irritant.  Other than that the stand is very well made and looks good on my counter."

5.0,true,"07 2 2017","Mike","Came fully assembled. Fits my Merkur razor perfectly and my Art of Shaving brush also fits","although I have to slide it in right where the quills meet the handle instead of at the bottom of the handle like shown in the picture. This hasn't been a problem so far. I was a little worried that the brush wouldn't fit at all being a different brand than the stand so I'm glad it does. The stand looks sharp and clean and feels solidly made."
5.0,true,"06 2 2017","Teancum","This stand is solid and heavy. Works great. I do wish it had a bowl under the brush but all the stands with the bowl on the bottom weren't as heavy or solid as this one.

This is exactly what I was looking for in every respect.  Thanks for a great product at a fair price!"

Gave it 4 stars because it is well made but disappointed it doesn't accommodate the best selling handle in the country.
5.0,true,"03 29 2018","chuck","Holds a Merkur 34C Long Handle Razor well.  Holds an Omega/Proraso Pro 48 at the comb (where bristles join handle) of the brush.  I prefer however a brush to be held far above the comb near the end of the brush handle.  (Most pictures of brush stands show them holding the brush at the comb","but I think that looks weird and top-heavy.  Call me weird then.)  The arms are too narrow for the Omega.  I have a tool for opening / closing links of chain and I used it but the result was a very wide V shape and I didn't want to put the somewhat fragile plastic handle in position while I used the tool to squeeze the V shape into more of a C shape.  So I put it back into its original shape.  Ill save as its a very good stand and if I get a brush that will work the way I want to suspend the brush I certainly will use this.\nwant to"

Not sure if its stainless steel but feels and look really solid and top class . only problem is it doesnt fit my brush handle but its not an issue as it fits below the brush handle. the base also has a type of velvet material in the bottom so i don't think it would be a good idea to leave it on your bathroom sink or where it can get wet.","great stand"
